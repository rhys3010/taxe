\chapter{User Interface Prototypes}
In the first week of development, several high-fidelity User Interface prototypes were created for the Android Application. In total there were 58 screens in order to showcase every functionality and some error and success cases. For purposes of keeping things concise, the entire document won't be included in this Appendix, only the 'essential' screens.
